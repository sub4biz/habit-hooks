Functions/methods over 12 lines almost always carry more than one responsibility, and that is the smell to chase — not the line count itself.

Analyse responsibilities first: what distinct concerns does this function/method handle? Ask: (1) Are these separate responsibilities that belong in different functions/methods? (2) Should this become a class with multiple methods? (3) Can you group cohesive data into objects to reduce local variables?

Avoid mechanical extraction. Pulling out a `helperA` / `helperB` purely to satisfy the threshold often hides the smell behind worse names and leaves the real shape untouched. Find true responsibility boundaries.

If responsibilities are tangled you may need to first *inline* functions/methods to see the whole picture before redistributing. Think of this when reducing line count seems particularly hard — stepping backwards often opens up better possibilities.

A concrete technique: write what the function/method does in one short sentence. Refactor until the code reads as close to that sentence as possible. If you cannot say what it does in one sentence, it almost certainly has more than one responsibility.
