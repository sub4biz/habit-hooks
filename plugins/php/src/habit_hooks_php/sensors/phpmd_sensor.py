"""Run PHPMD and print canonical smell findings.

PHPMD exits 2 when it finds violations and 1 on a real error, so a bare pipe
cannot tell a clean run from a crash. This wrapper runs PHPMD against the scoped
files, treats only 0/2 as success, and shapes each rule into the canonical
finding, mapping PHPMD rule names to smell keys.

The plugin ships the phar but not the interpreter, so the sensor names
``${detector:php}`` and its ``sys.argv[1]`` is the file this project runs for
php — the scoped files follow it. A php nobody installed never reaches here at
all: the part has no file for it, so the run answers with the missing-command
notice before anything is spawned.
