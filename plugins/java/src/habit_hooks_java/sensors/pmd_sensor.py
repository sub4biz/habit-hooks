"""Run PMD and print canonical smell findings.

PMD exits 4 when it finds violations, 0 when clean, and 1/2/5 on exceptions,
usage errors and recoverable errors (since 7.3.0) — so a bare pipe cannot tell
a clean run from a crash. This wrapper runs PMD against the scoped files,
treats only 0/4 as success, and shapes each violation into the canonical
finding, mapping PMD rule names to smell keys. Which ruleset it runs with is
the neighbouring ``pmd_ruleset``'s decision.

The sensor is run as a loose script (``${python} ${dir}/pmd_sensor.py``), so its
own directory is ``sys.path[0]`` and that neighbour is a plain top-level import
— the same in the installed package and in a vendored copy, since ``${dir}``
expands to whichever of the two won the override chain.

PMD 7's picocli reads a positional path that directly follows the ruleset value
as another ``-R`` value (``-R ruleset.xml file.java`` analyses nothing), so the
wrapper uses the short forms ``-R`` and per-file ``-d``, which do not. Verified
against PMD 7.26.0.

The sensor's own argv spells ``${detector:pmd} ${args} -- ${files}``, so
``sys.argv[1]`` is the file to run PMD by and ``sys.argv[2:]`` carries both
halves of ``[sensors.pmd] args`` on one side of a literal ``--`` and the scoped
files on the other — that is what lets a project pass any PMD flag
(``--aux-classpath``, ``--minimum-priority``, ...) through untouched instead of
every argv token becoming a bogus ``-d`` file argument.
