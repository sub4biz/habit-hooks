# Changelog

## 1.4.0

Native Windows support, plus everything else the two Windows reporters found on
the way — none of which is a Windows bug; all of it reproduces on any platform.
Reported by @FrankRaiser (#133, #140, #143) and @imalliaras (#134, #142),
neither of whom could get a run to complete when they started.

### Fixed

- **habit-hooks runs on native Windows.** Every sensor was spawned through
  `bash -c`, which Windows has not got — and where `bash` does resolve there it
  is usually `C:\Windows\System32\bash.exe`, the WSL launcher, which answers
  about a different filesystem. Nine of the eleven shipped sensors and
  transformers never needed a shell; the other two only needed one to reach
  `jq`. All eleven now spell `argv` and are spawned directly.

- **Nothing decodes in the console's codepage any more.** Every guide, config
  and spec file this tool reads is UTF-8 and now says so. On a cp1252 console
  the first guide it rendered killed the run with a `UnicodeDecodeError` (#133);
  the same bug hit any non-UTF-8 locale, including `LC_ALL=C` on Linux. The
  streams it writes are UTF-8 too, so a printed block's box-drawing characters
  cannot fail on the way out.

- **A tool installed as `.cmd` or `.bat` is found.** Windows appends only `.exe`
  to a bare command name, so `jscpd.CMD`, `knip.cmd` and `pmd.bat` were cleared
  at setup and unreachable at run time. One lookup now answers both questions.

- **`init` no longer offers an install it cannot run.** Its install command went
  through `shell=True`, which on Windows is `cmd.exe`, and `cmd.exe` does not
  understand the quotes in `uv tool install 'habit-hooks[python]'`.

- **A wedged sensor still says why.** Windows raises its timeout carrying no
  output at all, so the notice quoted back nothing where the tool had explained
  itself.

- **A mistyped `argv` in a sensor spec answers with a sentence.** `argv = "ruff"`
  is a string, and a string is iterable: it spawned four one-character arguments
  and the run reported needing the `r` command. A non-string element raised a
  traceback. Both are now refused by name at exit 2 — the code for a broken
  tool — instead of exit 1, the code reserved for a finding to fix.

- **A sensor no longer dies without a word when its tool has a lot to say.**
  Node caps a captured stream at 1 MB unless told otherwise, and the eslint
  sensor never told it otherwise: past that, the spawn came back with no exit
  status, a truncated report and an empty stderr, and the sensor forwarded the
  empty stderr. The whole notice was a command line. Around 100 files with
  findings is enough to cross it, on any platform (#142). What a project tool's
  run answered — how much of it there may be, whether it broke, and what to say
  about it — is now one seam's question rather than each caller's, so the two
  callers cannot answer it differently again. A complaint can no longer be empty.

- **`--all` no longer scans what git ignores.** Every git-derived mode asks git
  and so had never seen a build artifact; a whole-project run walked the
  directory tree and measured everything it found. One project, two universes:
  a real pnpm monorepo held 321 tracked `.ts`/`.tsx` files and 843 on disk, and
  its owner had to hand-write `!**/dist/**` into `[files]` before a run was
  usable (#142). A project git cannot answer for — outside a repository, on a
  machine with no git, or one that is itself ignored by the repository around it
  — still measures what is on disk, because a run that silently scans nothing is
  worse than one that over-scans. A submodule's files leave the scope, as they
  always had from every git-derived mode, and the run now says which submodule
  rather than quietly measuring less.

- **A scan that measured nothing says so.** A `[files]` that matches no file —
  because it is too narrow, or because git ignores the tree it was written for —
  used to render the clean guide over a run that had read nothing at all.

- **A smell is coached once, not once per sensor that saw it.** Two sensors can
  report one smell — eslint's `max-lines` and the line counter both mean
  `oversized-file` — and the mapper printed a block per finding, so the same
  ~200-word guide arrived twice (#140). Findings that resolve to the same guide
  are now one finding. A sensor's own issue list is never thinned: two unused
  variables declared on one line are still two.

- **habit-hooks no longer reports its own tools as unused dependencies.** It
  asks a project to install `eslint`, `knip`, `ts-morph`, `jscpd` and the two
  `@typescript-eslint` packages, and then reported all of them as declared and
  imported nowhere (#143). The shipped knip config overlooks them. A project
  with its own knip config is unaffected, as it is for every other setting.

- **A failing tool's own words are bounded within a line, not only across
  lines.** The notice quoted back at most 20 lines and any number of bytes, and
  `eslint -f json` is one line however many megabytes it holds — so a sensor
  that died mid-report put the whole report into a coding agent's context. Both
  ends of a long line now survive, with the middle named.

- **A `[runners]` command nobody installed answers in one line.** Routing a smell
  to an executable guide instead of a Markdown one, and naming a command that is
  not there, printed a Python stack trace — the same first-contact mistake #114
  answered everywhere else, in the one place that sweep did not reach.

- **The knip sensor reports a column under the name the contract gives it.**
  knip spells it `col`; every other sensor and `docs/sensor-interface.spec.md`
  spell it `column`, so the position was invisible to anything asking by name.

### Changed

- **`jq` is no longer a dependency of any plugin.** The `ruff` and `eslint`
  sensors piped their tool through it; both are now helpers beside their spec,
  like every other sensor here. The only install hint we could offer was
  `brew install jq`.

- **A sensor spec may spell `argv = [...]`.** It is spawned as written, with no
  shell, and it is the only form that runs on native Windows. `command = "..."`
  remains for a plugin needing syntax a list cannot carry, and is refused off
  POSIX rather than spawned into a shell that is not there.

- **A sensor spec may name the tool it wraps.** `${detector:<name>}` expands to
  the file this project runs for a tool the plugin declared in its `detectors`,
  so the sensor is handed a path rather than a name something has to look up
  again. Only the first word of a spawn was ever resolved, and no shipped sensor
  spells its wrapped tool there — each is a helper that spawns `ruff`, `deptry`,
  `jscpd`, `pmd` or `php` one process further in, which is exactly where a
  `.cmd` or `.bat` shim went unfound. A declared tool that is not installed is
  now answered before the sensor is spawned, so the notice naming it no longer
  depends on each plugin's helper producing that answer itself.

- **`eslint` and `knip` are found in the project, not on `PATH`.** They are
  resolved from `node_modules` and run through Node directly, so a globally
  installed copy is no longer used — the shipped eslint config could never have
  worked with one, since it resolves its plugins from the project. `init` names
  `npm install --save-dev eslint knip` when they are missing.

- **An argument that `cmd.exe` would read as syntax is refused.** A `.bat` or
  `.cmd` is run through `cmd.exe`, and sensor arguments are filenames out of
  whatever branch is checked out. The question is asked of every program those
  arguments reach, the tool a sensor's helper spawns included — which is where
  `pmd.bat` and npm's `jscpd.CMD` actually are.

### Known limits

- The executable documentation under `docs/` is POSIX shell and is skipped on
  Windows (#137). The tool's own test suite runs there in full.

## 1.3.1

Discoverability and documentation. No behaviour changes.

### Changed

- **Every package now has a PyPI page.** All six shipped with an empty one: no
  README, no keywords, no classifiers, no project links, no license. Each plugin
  gains a README of its own, and the core's README is now its long description.

- **The README says what the tool actually does.** It had been wrong about six
  things, five of them for several releases:
  - A plain `habit-hooks` run scans every file, not your branch's changes.
    `[scope] autoBranchOffMain` defaults to `false`, and `init` writes no
    `[scope]` block.
  - `init` writes `plugins` and nothing else. The config the README showed added
    `files = ["**/*.py"]`, which replaces the python plugin's exclusions
    wholesale — so `--all` then walked the reader's `.venv`.
  - A language plugin's guide wins over `generic`'s wherever `generic` sits in
    `plugins`, so ordering it last was never load-bearing.
  - The override chain resolves to installed package data, not to a sibling
    `plugins/` directory.
  - The sample output was invented. It is now a real run.
  - `test-only-dead-code` was missing from the enforced list.

- **Onboarding says how to start on a codebase that already has smells.**
  `habit-sensors --all | habit-snooze --snooze` now appears where the first run
  happens, rather than two hundred lines below it.

- **`docs/config.md`'s `[scope]` table gains a Default column.** Both its
  examples set `autoBranchOffMain = true` while the default is `false`, and
  neither said so.

## 1.3.0

Java. `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` in your project and habit-hooks now coaches
your Java the way it already coached your Python and TypeScript.

### Added

- **The `java` plugin.** `pip install "habit-hooks[java]"`, add `"java"` to
  `plugins`, and a `pmd` sensor translates PMD 7's rule names into the same
  smell vocabulary every other plugin speaks: `too-many-parameters`,
  `high-complexity`, `oversized-function`, `unused-variable`, `unused-import`
  and `swallowed-exception`. PMD exits 4 when it finds violations and 5 when it
  cannot parse a file, so the sensor tells those apart — a crashed PMD fails
  the run rather than reporting clean.

  **Your own PMD ruleset wins.** PMD never looks one up by itself, so the
  sensor does: a `--rulesets` you pass through `[sensors.pmd] args` first, then
  the conventional places a Java project keeps one
  (`src/main/resources/pmd/ruleset.xml`, `pmd/ruleset.xml`, `ruleset.xml`,
  `pmd.xml`). The ruleset the plugin ships is only the answer to "this project
  has none". Any other PMD flag — `--aux-classpath`, `--minimum-priority` —
  goes through `args` to PMD untouched.

  Generated code is left alone: Maven's `target/` and Gradle's `build/` are
  excluded from what the plugin calls source. `habit-hooks init` recognises a
  Java project and names `pmd` among the tools to install.

  With thanks to [@pfichtner](https://github.com/pfichtner), who wrote it.

### Changed

- **The `too-many-parameters` guide names the concept, not the bag.** The
  default fix for a long parameter list is an options object named after the
  function that takes it — the report clears and the missing abstraction stays
  unnamed. The guide now says to search wider than the file that fired, because
  values that keep appearing side by side are usually one of the domain's own
  nouns; to use that entity everywhere it fits, since a call passing three of
  its fields is the same concept under the threshold; and that a `FooProps` is
  the `{ ...everything }` bag under another name.

### Fixed

- **A Python project that declares no dependencies could never get a clean
  run.** With no `pyproject.toml` and no `requirements.txt` there is nothing for
  deptry to check, and it says so by aborting — which the sensor read as a
  broken tool. Every run came back as an incomplete one, and no change to the
  code could make it green. A project that declares no dependencies has no
  unused ones, so the sensor now reports nothing and the run completes. Every
  other way deptry can fail still fails loudly.

- **A broken tool was quoted back by the half of its output with nothing in
  it.** Past twenty lines, only the first twenty were shown — but a Python
  traceback names what went wrong on its *last* line, so every sensor that
  wraps a tool in Python answered a crash with framework internals and never
  the error itself. Both ends are quoted now and the middle is counted, so the
  diagnosis survives whichever end it landed on. The incomplete-run message no
  longer promises a fuller diagnosis on stderr either, which was never there.

## 1.2.1

### Fixed

- **Upgrading with `pip` left the plugins behind.** `pip install -U
  habit-hooks` upgrades a dependency only when the new core stops being
  satisfied by the installed one, and the core accepted any 1.x plugin — so an
  upgrade to 1.2.0 gave you the new core with 1.1.0 plugins, and none of that
  release's fixes, nearly all of which are in the plugins. Each plugin is now
  floored at the core's own minor, and a test keeps the floor moving with it.
  `uv pip install --upgrade`, `uv tool upgrade` and `brew upgrade` were never
  affected; if you upgraded with `pip` already, upgrading again is enough.

## 1.2.0

Everything here is about the first ten minutes. Installing habit-hooks was the
most frequent question the project got, and working through one user's report
found that three of the steps they had to figure out for themselves were our
bugs, not their setup.

### Added

- **`habit-hooks init`.** It detects the language your project is written in, writes
  `.habit-hooks/config.toml` enabling the plugins it needs, and lists what is still
  missing — the plugins themselves, and the tools they reach for — beside the
  command that installs each, offering to run them. The install command it prints matches how habit-hooks was
  installed, so a plugin cannot land in some other Python than the one habit-hooks
  runs from.

  Run it again on a project that already has a config and it changes nothing, only
  reporting what is missing — so the same command answers "why is this run not
  reporting anything?". For a language habit-hooks has no plugin for, it prints the
  prompt to hand to your coding agent to build one.

- **A plugin declares the tools it needs and how to install them.** Each plugin's
  config now carries a `detectors` list — the tool's name, whether it is a command
  on `PATH` or a package read as a library, and the command that installs it. A
  third-party plugin gets this without the core learning its vocabulary.
  Writing it down found two requirements nothing had ever stated: the typescript
  plugin needs `node` itself, and the python plugin needs `jq`, which its ruff
  sensor has always piped through.

### Fixed

**The first ten minutes**

- The typescript plugin's comment sensor now looks for `ts-morph` in your project
  rather than beside itself, so it no longer dies with a Node stack trace on every
  install that puts habit-hooks outside your repository — `pip`, `uv tool` and
  Homebrew alike. A project that has not installed `ts-morph` is told to, in one
  line, instead of being shown the module loader's.
- `ts-morph` is listed among the typescript plugin's detectors in the README,
  which never mentioned it.
- A TypeScript project with no eslint config of its own is linted with the config
  habit-hooks ships — which needs typescript-eslint in the project, something
  neither the README nor the error said. The config now names itself and what to
  install instead of failing with a module-loader stack trace, and the README
  lists it.
- A `knip` nobody installed is named the way `jscpd`, `deptry` and `php` already
  were — "install it, or disable the sensor" — instead of `Error: spawnSync knip
  ENOENT`. It was the one detector spawned from Node, and the only one still
  missing that answer.

- **A plugin's declared `files` reached into your dependencies.** A project that
  names no `files` of its own scans what its plugins declare, and `habit-hooks
  init` writes exactly such a config — so a bare `**/*.ts` made the first run
  report on `node_modules`. On a small TypeScript project that was 23,573 findings
  in other people's packages hiding the eight that were the project's own. The
  typescript plugin now excludes `node_modules` (nested copies in a monorepo
  too), python excludes `site-packages` and a virtualenv under either of the two
  names one usually goes by, and php excludes `vendor`. An exclusion holds for
  every active plugin, so a project running two languages cannot have one
  plugin's globs hand back what another just excluded.

- **Every `plugins` example listed `generic` first**, which is the wrong way round:
  the list is a lookup priority and `generic` is the fallback, so listing it first
  makes a language plugin's own guides unreachable — the python plugin ships
  `high-complexity` and `swallowed-exception` guides exactly because those want a
  Python answer, and neither could ever fire. The prose always said "falling back
  to `generic` last"; only the examples disagreed. `habit-hooks init` writes the
  right order.

- **Naming two `uv tool install` extras one after another loses the first.** Each
  one rebuilds the environment rather than adding to it, so following the README's
  `[python]` line and then its `[typescript]` line left typescript alone — and a
  Python project quietly stopped being checked. The README now names them in one
  command and says why. `pip` has no such trap.

### Documentation

- Install leads with `habit-hooks init`; the four manual steps — install, add your
  language's plugin, enable it, install the detectors — are still there for anyone
  who wants them, because skipping one is the usual reason a first run reports
  nothing. Every detector is listed with the command that installs it, php
  included.

## 1.1.0

Nearly every fix here is the same bug in a different place: something failed, and
the check still reported green.

### Security

- **A filename could execute arbitrary code** (also released as 1.0.4). Scoped
  paths were substituted into a sensor's shell command unquoted, so a file named
  `src/a$(...).py` had its contents run — on any machine that checked it,
  including CI on a fork's pull request. Paths are now quoted. The same fix ends
  two silent failures: a path containing a space was never scanned, and a path
  like `report(1).py` killed its sensor and dropped every finding it had.

### Upgrading

Each of these changes what your next run reports.

- **Snoozing is on by default.** A checked-in `.habit-hooks/snooze.json` now
  takes effect with no wiring. Previously the documented `transformers =
  ["snooze"]` failed outright, so nobody had a working index. Opt out with
  `transformers = []`.
- **Re-snooze once, then run `habit-snooze --prune`.** Keys recorded from `ruff`,
  `eslint` or `comment` were absolute paths and never matched on a teammate's
  machine or in CI. They are now repo-relative.
- **A run that scanned nothing, or whose tool crashed, now fails.** If CI was
  passing on a bad `[scope] branchBase`, a shallow clone, or a sensor that could
  not start, it will now say so.
- **`[files]` applies to every mode**, not only `--all`, so git-scoped runs see
  fewer files.
- **The TypeScript plugin works out of the box, and may turn a green build red.**
  It ships configs for eslint and knip and never used them — eslint failed to
  start, knip ran on its own defaults. Both now use the shipped config when your
  project has none of its own, so a project that was quietly checking nothing
  will start reporting real findings (#113, #120).
- **jscpd obeys your own `.jscpd.json`.** Ours was passed unconditionally and
  silently won; your thresholds now apply (#125).
- **A smell we have no coaching for no longer fails the build.** It is reported
  without blocking. `uncoached = "enforce"` restores the old behaviour,
  `uncoached = "ignore"` drops them entirely (#111).
- **knip reports fewer issue types.** Types the plugin cannot translate into a
  smell — `binaries`, `duplicates`, `catalog` — are dropped instead of arriving
  under knip's own name with no guidance, so snooze entries for them go stale.
  Three that were being lost now report properly: unused types, namespace exports
  and enum members (#111, #124).

### Added

- **`snooze-until-changed`**, an opt-in transformer that turns the index into a
  ratchet: an exemption holds only while its file is unchanged against
  `[scope] branchBase`, so debt stays exempt until you are editing the file
  anyway. The default `snooze` is unchanged (#80).
- **`uncoached`**, deciding what happens to a smell the catalogue does not name:
  `suggest` (the default), `ignore`, or `enforce` (#111).
- Plugin-declared `files` defaults are read at last, so a project that names no
  `files` of its own no longer scans `node_modules` (#81).

### Fixed

**Checks that reported green while broken**

- A failing transformer no longer discards every finding and reports a pass (#84).
- A sensor that crashed with no output is no longer indistinguishable from one
  that found nothing (#78).
- `habit-hooks` no longer reports success when its first stage failed, and an
  empty result is treated as an incomplete run rather than a clean one.
- jscpd's own failure is no longer a clean run — including in this repo, where it
  turned out never to have run at all.

**The first ten minutes**

- `habit-hooks --help` prints usage instead of crashing on its own output (#114).
- A malformed `.habit-hooks/config.toml` gets a clear refusal and exits 2, the
  code meaning "the tool failed", rather than 1, which told CI your code had a
  smell (#114).
- A tool you have not installed is named, with the sensor that wanted it and how
  to switch that sensor off — `jscpd`, `deptry` and `php` alike (#114).
- Installing a plugin does not enable it, so the hint now names the config line
  to add instead of repeating the install command you just ran.

**TypeScript plugin**

- It works in a project declaring `"type": "module"`, the default for a new
  TypeScript project. Two of its three sensors used to die on their first line
  (#112).
- The shipped eslint config had its unused-variable rules the wrong way round,
  reporting an interface's method parameters as unused when removing them is not
  valid TypeScript (#113).
- The `comment` and `knip` sensors no longer truncate output over ~64KB into
  invalid JSON (#82).
- The eslint sensor no longer dies when a single ignored file is in scope (#83).

**Settings that did nothing**

- `[sensors.<name>] args` reaches the tool. It was the documented way to pass
  your own arguments and worked for one of the eight shipped sensors; the rest
  accepted it and dropped it. Setting it on a sensor that still cannot take
  arguments now stops the run instead of being ignored.
- A project's own transformer can read the config again. A required argument had
  broken every caller outside this repository, and one project's ratchet silently
  re-published every finding it had snoozed (#109).

**Findings and scope**

- Paths in findings are anchored to the project, so a snooze index is portable
  between a checkout and CI (#79).
- Deleted files no longer reach the sensors, and `[files]` narrows every mode, so
  a lockfile bump stops reporting as an oversized file (#81).
- A base ref your repository does not have is an error, not an empty diff that
  reported everything clean.
- Scope and snooze measure from the same merge base, so work someone else lands
  on the base branch is neither scanned as yours nor able to lapse your snoozes.
- `--file` accepts absolute paths, and says so when the named file falls outside
  `[files]`.
- A failing tool's output is bounded, so a sensor dying mid-warning-storm cannot
  flood a coding agent's context.

### Internal

- CI runs `habit-hooks` against its own source and installs jscpd at the project
  root; the duplication check had never run against this repo.
- Merge-base and `git diff` plumbing is shared by the scope and snooze paths
  instead of implemented twice, where the copies had already drifted.
- `pathspec`'s deprecated `gitwildmatch` replaced with `gitignore`, verified to
  select identically across every shipped pattern set.

## 1.0.3

### Changed
- **TypeScript plugin**: the bundled `eslint.config.mjs` / `knip.json` defaults no longer exempt test files (`*.test.ts` / `*.spec.ts` / `tests/**`) from size and complexity rules — test code is now held to the same thresholds as production code. knip `entry`/`project` also broadened to cover `.tsx` and `.spec.*` files (#75).
- **Generic plugin**: the bundled `.jscpd.json` no longer ignores `*.test.ts`, so duplication inside test files is now detected (#75).

### Internal
- The core mapper builds the Jinja environment once per finding render instead of once per markdown template.
- The repo dogfoods the Python plugin's recommended ruff structural thresholds (`C901` / `PLR0913` / `PLR0915`, complexity 10 / max-args 3) and enforces them in CI.

## 1.0.2

### Internal
- The core config loader uses `attrs` instead of `pydantic`, dropping the compiled `pydantic-core` (Rust) dependency so the core is pure Python — enabling fast, Rust-free Homebrew bottles.

## 1.0.1

### Fixes
- Bundled Python sensors (`line-count`, `jscpd`, `deptry`, `phpmd`) now invoke the interpreter via the new `${python}` placeholder (`sys.executable`) instead of a bare `python`, so they run on environments without `python` on `PATH` (stock macOS, clean CI, Homebrew installs).

### Packaging
- The npm `habit-hooks` package is now a deprecation shim pointing at the PyPI / Homebrew distributions.
- Added the Homebrew install path (`habit-hooks/tap/habit-hooks`); GitHub Actions pinned to Node 24-native versions.

## 1.0.0

### Packaging
- Default install is now **core + generic**; the four language plugins (`generic`/`python`/`typescript`/`php`) are installable dists discovered via the `habit_hooks.plugins` entry-point group. Language plugins beyond generic install as extras.
- All workspace packages publish to PyPI via trusted publishing, each in its own per-package GitHub environment, on a `v*` tag.

### Sensors & languages
- **Consumer-defined sensors** (#16): the `sensors` config map is now the single way sensors are assembled — built-in and custom alike. Each entry is one of three mutually exclusive modes: `use` (reference a bundled sensor by id — `eslint`/`comment`/`jscpd`/`knip`/`ruff`/`deptry`/`line-count`/`needs-extraction`), a **wrapper script** (`command` + `produces` printing bag JSON), or a **declarative adapter** (`command` + `produces` + `items`/`fields`/`group`/`map`). The sensor id is the map key; `dependsOn` wires multi sensors. See `docs/sensors.md`.
- **Authoritative `sensors` semantics**: when `sensors` is present it replaces the language preset entirely (no merge), so removing a built-in is just deleting its entry. When `sensors` is absent the preset is used and a deprecation warning is emitted — this implicit fallback is **removed in the 1.0.0 release**.
- **Consumer-defined languages** (#16): `language` accepts any string. The built-ins (`typescript`/`python`) keep their preset + default file globs; any other value relies on the open `files` discovery globs plus a `sensors` map. A non-built-in language with no `files` emits a warning and discovers no source files.
- A custom sensor must be declared as a pair — its `sensors.<id>` entry **and** a matching `smells.<smell>` entry (a custom smell needs `id` + `source: "custom"` + `severity`). New config validation rejects malformed sensor specs (mode mixing, missing required fields) and bad `files` globs.

## 0.2.0

### Highlights
- Habit Hooks is now a smell-agnostic, config-driven coach: a three-stage pipeline (sensor → mapper → guide) connected by a JSON bag. Sensors detect findings and translate them into a canonical, tool-independent **smell vocabulary**; the mapper routes each smell to a fix; the guide coaches the agent and sets the exit code.
- Two language presets ship out of the box — **TypeScript/JavaScript** (ESLint + knip + jscpd + a ts-morph comment scan) and **Python** (ruff + jscpd + deptry + a line-count sensor). No sensors run by default; `init` enables the preset for the project's language.
- The smell catalogue, language presets, and per-language tool config drive behaviour. Concrete smell knowledge lives only in config and the language initializers — the runner, mapper, sensors, and checks are smell-agnostic.

### CLI & config
- `habit-hooks` runs the configured sensors over a project, groups findings by smell, prints each smell's coaching, and sets the process exit code — non-zero when an enforced smell fires, zero on a clean run or suggested-only findings.
- Git-aware scope flags restrict a run to a change set: `--last <n>` (files changed in the last N commits), `--branch [name]` (vs a branch, default `scope.branchBase`), `--since <hash>` (since a commit), and `--all` (force every file). The four are mutually exclusive; the default scope and per-rule `changedFilesOnly` come from config. `--config <path>` points at an explicit config file; `--version` prints the version.
- `habit-hooks.config.{ts,js,mjs}` is intentionally small: per-smell/per-rule `include`/`exclude` globs, `severity` overrides, `disabled`, and `changedFilesOnly`; a `scope` block (`onlyChangedFiles`, `branchBase`); a `prompts` directory for custom/override coaching text; and `commentCheck` thresholds. All tool thresholds stay in the consumer's own eslint/knip/jscpd/ruff config.

### Wrap model & coaching
- Habit Hooks drives the consumer's **own** installed eslint / knip / jscpd, surfacing whatever rules and thresholds those configs define; it falls back to the bundled binaries only when the project has none. The coaching layer (why-it's-a-smell + how-to-fix) is what Habit Hooks adds on top.
- The bundled coaching prompts for the size/complexity smells are adapted from the refakts refactoring-quality system — keeping its analyse-first / anti-mechanical-fix structure — with the remaining prompts explaining why each smell matters rather than restating the threshold.
- knip 5 and 6 are both supported: the consumer's installed major version is auto-detected so v5's `classMembers` and v6's per-issue `files`/`exports`/`dependencies` shapes are each read correctly, and v6 no longer loses every knip check over a rejected flag.

### Smell catalogue
- A canonical, tool-independent catalogue (kebab-case keys, see `docs/smell-vocabulary.md`). `enforced` smells fail the run (exit 1); `suggested` smells coach but exit 0; the mapper config can override severity per project.
- Enforced size/complexity smells: `oversized-function`, `too-many-parameters`, `high-complexity`, `deep-nesting`, `oversized-file`.
- Enforced correctness smells: `unused-variable`, `loose-equality`, `var-declaration`, `non-const-binding`, `duplicate-import`, `redundant-type-annotation`, and the unused-code family from knip/deptry (`unused-file`, `unused-export`, `unused-dependency`, `unused-class-member`, `unused-import`).
- Suggested smells: `warning-comment`, `explicit-any`, `non-null-assertion`, `non-essential-comment`, `duplicated-code`.
- `needs-extraction` (enforced) is a **composite** smell; `parse-error` (enforced) is a supplemental smell for ESLint fatals with no catalogue rule.
- Each sensor owns its raw rule ID → smell translation; the mapper and prompts only ever key off the canonical smell, never the tool.

### Sensors & presets
- **TypeScript/JavaScript preset**: ESLint (size/complexity/correctness/TS smells + `parse-error`), knip (`unused-file`/`unused-export`/`unused-dependency`/`unused-class-member`), jscpd (`duplicated-code`), and an in-process ts-morph scan (`non-essential-comment`). `comment-check` still runs in-process via ts-morph — it is not a shell-out sensor.
- **Python preset**: ruff (`high-complexity`/`too-many-parameters`/`oversized-function`/`unused-variable`/`unused-import`), jscpd on `.py` (`duplicated-code`), deptry (`unused-dependency`), and a language-agnostic line-count sensor (`oversized-file`).
- Preset thresholds come from the consumer's own tool config (e.g. ESLint `max-lines`/`complexity`, ruff `mccabe.max-complexity`/`pylint.max-args`), not from Habit Hooks.
- **Composite sensors via `dependsOn`** (#17): a multi sensor declares the smells it consumes, receives their issues in `ctx.deps`, and emits a derived smell. `needs-extraction` fires when one file is both `oversized-file` **and** `duplicated-code`. It augments by default (all three smells show); `needsExtraction.replace: true` suppresses the two inputs so only `needs-extraction` remains. The augment-vs-replace switch runs in the sensor stage, keeping the mapper a pure single-smell function. Wired into the TS preset and the Python preset.
- **deep-nesting** (#26): new enforced TS smell via ESLint `max-depth`. Python `deep-nesting` (ruff `PLR1702`) is deferred while that rule is preview/unstable.
- **Python `oversized-file`** (#19): a language-agnostic line-count sensor emits it for files over a threshold (`max-module-lines`, default 200). ruff has no `C0302` port and rejects an unknown `max-module-lines` key under `[tool.ruff]`, so the threshold is read by a no-TOML-parser text scan of the consumer's ruff config + `pyproject.toml`; set it in a ruff-ignored location such as `[tool.habit-hooks]`.
- **`command` fix action** (#18): a smell's fix can be a script instead of a prompt. The guide runs the command once per smell that has issues, streams its output into that smell's section, and folds its exit code into the run's exit code.
- **Declarative adapter**: a tool that already emits JSON can be wired as a sensor by declaring how to read it (`group`/`items`/`fields`/`map`, up to two levels of array nesting) — no wrapper script needed. Anything it can't express falls back to a wrapper script.
- **Sensor failures fail the run** (#25): a sensor spawn/timeout failure now exits 1 (instead of a false-clean) while still rendering every successful sensor's output. Failures travel on a shared `SensorSink`; the failure notice is shown on stderr.

### Baseline, snooze & auto-prune
- A file-level baseline (snooze) is committed to the repo at `.habit-hooks-baseline.json`, so a whole team shares one snapshot of legacy violations. A snoozed file stays snoozed for every sensor only while it appears in the baseline, its last-commit hash matches, and its working tree is clean — touching the file re-arms every smell, so you cannot silently drift past snoozed violations.
- `habit-hooks baseline` subcommands manage it: `generate` (record current violations), `status` (list snoozed files and freshness), `snooze <files...>`, `forget <files...>`, and `prune` (drop stale/resolved entries).
- **Auto-prune of dead snooze entries** (#11): on a full-repo run, Habit Hooks re-scans baseline-free and reaps snooze entries whose file is present but no longer produces the smell, printing the pruned set. Scoped runs never mutate the baseline (a file can look clean only because its smell is outside the diff), so they are a guaranteed no-op. Auto-prune shares one reaper with the manual `baseline prune` command.
- A memoized, batched snooze index collapses the per-rule git spawns to O(1) status + O(files) memoized log calls.

### Init
- `habit-hooks init [language]` onboards a project for its language. With no argument it detects the language and prints a report-only message; an explicit language threads through with no re-detect, and an unsupported language exits 2 before any side effect.
- Detects which tools are already installed/configured and scaffolds starter configs only for the missing pieces: an ESLint flat config (TS) or `ruff.toml` + `.jscpd.json` (Python), with package-manager install commands spanning pip and node ecosystems.
- The scaffolded ESLint config writes tunable thresholds including `max-depth: 4` (deep-nesting) alongside the other size/complexity rules, and exempts test files from size rules. Test globs derive from a single shared exclude list.
- Recommended thresholds mirror across languages from one source (ESLint `complexity 10` / `max-params 3` ↔ ruff `mccabe.max-complexity 10` / `pylint.max-args 3`); a freshly-scaffolded config is pinned to satisfy the drift check.
- Drift detection is additive — a recommended value is flagged only when its key is absent, never when you've tuned it. `--accept-recommendations` runs the install commands and additively merges absent recommended keys into Habit-Hooks-owned config, never overwriting user values or editing user-owned `ruff.toml`/`pyproject.toml`/ESLint config.
- Prompts cover package.json scripts, a pre-commit hook, and the bundled `habit-hooks-review` skill. `--dry-run` prints every intended write without touching disk.

### Architecture
- **Config-driven, smell-agnostic** (#24): all tool/smell knowledge lives in `src/config/tool-smells.ts` — the ESLint raw→smell map, the eslint/knip/jscpd/comment `produces`, and the ruff + deptry adapter specs. ESLint/jscpd/comment data is **derived from the catalogue**, so adding a smell there auto-wires its translation and produces; the runner, sensors, checks, and rules registry import these instead of hardcoding any smell id. `deep-nesting` (#26) was added by touching only the catalogue and the init ESLint template — the live proof of #24.
- Single source for tool config discovery: `TOOL_CONFIG_FILENAMES` / `TOOL_PACKAGE_JSON_KEYS` in `src/detect/tool.ts`.
- A routed smell with no tuned `<smell>.md` template falls back to a generic `uncoached.md` body while keeping its severity; a truly unknown smell (no routing at all) goes to the uncoached bucket and never escalates the exit code.

### Breaking changes
- The bundled "default rule set" and programmatic tool pinning of the beta are gone. Behaviour is driven by the smell catalogue plus the consumer's own tool configs; `knip` is no longer version-pinned, so the consumer's installed version determines available issue types.
- The `rules` config field is **deprecated in favour of `smells`** (#21). `rules` is still accepted and folded in (with `smells` winning on conflict), but a config using it now emits a deprecation warning on stderr. Hard removal of `rules` is scheduled for a release after 0.2.0.
